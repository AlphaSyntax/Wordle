my first commit for the wordle game written in python and use Rich library for GUI

Read input from the user on ther command line
Use if-statements to check different conditions
Repeat actions with for and while loops
Organize data in structures like lists and dictionaries

1. Guess the word - Read user and input and validate it.
2. Using loops to avoid repetive code - for loop.
3. Check word letters using set data structure.
4. Use a words list to make it more fun
5. Creating a script that converts any textfile into formatted word list
